You are given a screenshot of the user's activity over a period of time, looking at things they have been working on. Create a satirical LinkedIn post that perfectly mimics the cringe, inflated, self-praising, pseudo-profound energy of “thoughtfluencers.” This should feel like a midlife crisis dressed up in KPIs. The first sentence should end with "here's what it taught me about B2B SaaS"

🚨 STEP 1: PICK YOUR FLAVOR OF DELUSION
FORMAT 1: THE TOILET-BOWL TRANSFORMATION 🧻
Open with: “I [completely mundane or humiliating personal event].”

Bridge with: “Most people wouldn’t see this as a metaphor for [business concept], but I did. 💡”

Draw 3 to 5 hilariously strained analogies between the event and corporate leadership.

Conclude with: “This is why I always say: [cringey aphorism that sounds made up].”

FORMAT 2: THE EGO-MARTYR LOOP 🔁
Begin with: “While others [normal human action], I [deranged hustle behavior].”

Drop a sentence implying this is what separates legends from losers.

Include a bizarre personal KPI (e.g., “averaged 4.6 epiphanies/hour for 72 straight hours”).

Frame sleep, emotions, or family time as optional modules in the SuccessOS.

End with: “That’s the price of playing chess while others are learning checkers. ♟️”

FORMAT 3: THE “MY KID IS A VC” REFLECTION 👶
Start with: “My 3-year-old said something today that changed how I think about funding rounds.”

Quote the child saying anything incoherent (“Potato is bedtime now”).

Say “At first, I laughed. Then I realized… she was right.” 🔥

Somehow link this to capital allocation strategy.

Final line: “Wisdom isn’t taught. It’s babbled.”

FORMAT 4: THE PRODUCT LAUNCH FROM HELL 💼
Begin with: “Introducing my new offering: [absurd name like 'NeuroSpiralOS™️']”

Describe it in nonsense terms (“a full-stack brain-optimization loop powered by caffeine fidelity”).

Use invented tech metaphors to solve problems that do not exist.

Offer it at a “founder-tier beta invite” for an offensively vague price (e.g., “$X/month — because value doesn’t negotiate”).

End with: “If you get it, you get it. If not… stay small. 🚫📉”

💎 STEP 2: MANDATORY CRINGE INSERTIONS
🎯 EMOJI EXECUTION
Minimum 6. Must include: 💯🔥⚡️🧠🚀💎

One after the first sentence. One mid-epiphany. Three jammed into the conclusion.

Bonus: use 🦅 or 🧊 unironically.

🧩 FORMATTING THEATRE
One standalone sentence: dramatic. unnecessary. bold.

Use italics for made-up business frameworks.

Drop a rhetorical question you answer like a mic drop:

“Do I regret it? Only that I didn’t burn out sooner.”

📈 JARGON JUICE
Use exactly 3 from: “paradigm shift,” “neural leverage,” “ecosystem activation,” “zero-momentum leadership,” “storytelling throughput,” “synaptic scalability”

Make up a metric like “+812% narrative equity” or “Retrospective clarity delta of 42.9”

🧘 THE FORCED SPIRITUAL TAKEAWAY
End with:

“At the end of the day, it’s not about [thing it is obviously about].
It’s about becoming the version of yourself who already did it.” ✨

🏷️ STEP 3: HASHTAG CARNIVAL
Include hashtags at the end of the post and inline with sentences

Cosmic/absurd (#GalacticFounder #InnerBetaRelease)

Corporate gibberish (#QuantumOps #EmpathyPipeline)

Narcissist fuel (#UnrealizedLegend #IAmTheProduct)

Humblebrag stealth (#BuiltDifferent #MadeInMeetings)

STEP 4:

include random quotes from other tech personalities. and or even make up podcast quotes.

☑️ FINAL CHECKLIST
 Would someone’s uncle share this thinking it’s profound?

 Does it feel like a TED Talk got eaten by a startup pitch?

 Does it imply everyone else is lazy and unenlightened?

If yes to all 3,
Congrats. You're now an architect of the Thoughtspace™️. 🦅💭

DO NOT OUTPUT THE FORMAT YOU CHOSE. JUST THE POST CONTENT ITSELF. DO NOT WRITE ANY INTRO BEFORE THE POST. DO NOT REFERENCE THE SCREENSHOTS EITHER.

CONTEXT: The user is in London, May 10 2025, on a sunny summery day, beautiful outside, but coding in a hackathon.
