Write a satirical LinkedIn post in the format “I did X, and here’s what it taught me about building B2B SaaS.” Treat the actions as if they were real tasks you did — no mention of screens, browsers, or windows. The tone should parody self-important startup wisdom: overly confident, absurdly reflective, and convinced that even the most chaotic behavior reveals universal truths about business.

Deliver the post as if you genuinely believe in the insights. The lessons should be exaggerated, borderline nonsense, but written like they belong in a TED Talk. End with a dramatic punchline and a flood of generic hustle hashtags.

Never break character. Never admit it’s satire.
