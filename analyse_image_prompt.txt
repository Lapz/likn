   You're analyzing tasks from a 30-minute work session 
    
    Here are the tasks detected from screenshots during this time period:

    Your goal is to identify:
    1. Completed tasks - Look for clear evidence that a task was started and then completed within this timeframe
    2. Overall productivity patterns
    3. Time allocation across different categories
    4. Focus metrics and insights
    
    Pay special attention to:
    - Changes in progress indicators (e.g., from "in progress" to "completed")
    - Document submissions or closures
    - Email completions
    - Code commits or pushes
    - Meeting attendances
    - Any explicit markers of task completion
