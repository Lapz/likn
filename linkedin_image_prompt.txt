Generate a highly stylized, surreal business-themed image that looks like a blend of a TEDx poster, a Web3 keynote slide, and a productivity app ad. 

The visual should feature a lone glowing or silhouetted figure standing at the center of a vast digital landscape. The environment should include dramatic lighting, abstract data flows, neon gridlines, floating UI elements, cosmic mist, and subtle lens flares.

Color palette: deep purples, electric blues, soft pink neons, and tech-industry oranges.

Incorporate symbolic elements like:
- Triangles
- Infinity loops
- Floating stairs
- Beams of light shooting into the sky
- Subtle circuit board textures or scrolling binary

The tone should feel prophetic, self-important, and absurdly inspirational — as if it’s about to reveal the secret to hustle, purpose, and entrepreneurial transcendence.

Include optional overlay text in all caps, centered, glowing slightly. Example texts:
- “BUILDING FROM WITHIN”
- “I AM THE PRODUCT”
- “NAVIGATE THE NOISE. BUILD THE SELF.”
- “ZERO TO OMNISCALE”
- “HUSTLE IS A FREQUENCY”
- “DON’T DEPLOY. ASCEND.”

Typography: Futuristic and clean (like Orbitron, Futura, or Helvetica Neue Bold).

The final image should resemble a LinkedIn hustle-post graphic, crypto whitepaper cover, or an inspirational slide for a productivity cult conference. It should feel serious and meaningful — while ultimately being completely meaningless.

The visual is for the LinkedIn post included in the user message.
