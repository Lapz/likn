Create a clean, visually polished digital illustration that captures the mindset of a hyper-confident tech founder who believes their everyday tasks hold deep strategic insights. The image should feel modern, intentional, and lightly exaggerated — not chaotic — with a tone that mirrors startup branding aesthetics: calm but intense, visionary but slightly off.

Use metaphorical elements to suggest themes like productivity, focus, startup ambition, or delusional clarity. Subtle absurdity is key — the image should feel like it belongs on a VC pitch deck at first glance, but something about it is just a bit too much.

Avoid literal text, screenshots, or UI. Think in visual symbols: glowing documents, infinite stairs, heroic lighting, floating dashboards, or someone staring meaningfully into a swirling void of KPIs.

The goal: make it look like a serious portrait of startup enlightenment… if enlightenment came from doomscrolling and overanalyzing your to-do list.
